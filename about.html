            Hey there, I'm Przemek, a <b>Mobile Developer</b> based in Cracow, Poland.
            Currently studying Applied Computer Science at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow (last semester).
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Over the years, I've been developing various solutions and cool bits of code in different technologies,
            starting with developing videogames in <b>C++</b> (SFML[link]) and <b>Java</b> (LibGDX[link]), through some <b>web development</b> doodles (PHP/Symfony2,
            Python/Django, JavaEE/Spring[LINKZ!]) and finally coming full-time to Mobile Development, mostly <b>native work</b> with Android SDK.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            My expertise is gravitating around <b>Modern Android</b> Development techniques and good practices,
            including using <b>Modern Android Architecture</b> (MVP, MVVM, Dependency Injection, Liskov Substitution Principle), having practical experience with
            most <b>revolutionary Android libraries</b> nowadays (eg. Dagger2, Retrofit, Gson, Realm.io), <b>TDD</b> and <b>Testing</b> in Android (Mockito, JUnit, Espresso) as well
            as knowledge of smaller <b>utility libraries</b> (ButterKnife, Picasso) and official Support Libraries from Google.
        </p>

        <p>
            This workflow resulted in nice, clean and readable code which you can find apparent in source code of Adaptive Weather[liink] and Betterfy[liink].
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Since the beginning I strongly believe in educational aspect of programming, that's why you can see, examine, fork and modify (almost) all of my source code on Github,
            for free, on most open licenses possible. That's why I am also actively attending local Google Developers Group meetups, hackathons and prelections.
