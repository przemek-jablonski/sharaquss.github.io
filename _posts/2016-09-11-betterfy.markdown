<p3>Description:</p3>
<div class="separator"></div>
<p>
    Native Android client for Spotify streaming service.
</p>

<p>
    App is targeted for premium Spotify subscribers, who happen to have low-specs Android smartphone. Low performance overhead, quick booting, simplified API connectivity and way more stability.
    Offers unique functionalities, which are absent in mobile client, like set of <b>most listened tracks</b> and albums over the course of week, month, year and account lifetime, <b>recommendations</b> and <b>music taste</b> tracking system.   
</p>



<p3>Development:</p3>
<div class="separator"></div>
<p>
    Application was built using <b>modern approach</b> to developing Android applications.
    Features most commonly used open source libraries in the community, like Square's <b>Butterknife</b> binder, Picasso, <b>Retrofit(v2)</b> HTTP client as well as <b>Realm</b> database, <b>JUnit and Mockito testing</b> suite.
</p>

<p>
    Spotify communication is done via their proprietary set of APIs.
    Some functionalities are implemented using their SDK (like some authentication and authorization elements), but I generally tried to do things from scratch on my own.
