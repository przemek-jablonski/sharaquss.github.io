<p> Bunch of utility tools and calculators for in-depth exploring some of the values and issues of FEM's partial differential equations. <p>

<p> Those are a little helpers which tend to significantly reduce time and effort during solving some thermodynamical problems using Finite Element Method.</p>

<p> Calculations span across getting thermal distribution across physical mesh of given model, solving partial differential equations for Finie Elements, tracking differential boundary values on timeline of a given process etc.</p>
