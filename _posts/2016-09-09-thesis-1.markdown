<p>My Engineering (BSc) Thesis (research and dev project).</p>

<p>{{page.shortdesc}}</p>

<p>My Engineering Thesis consists of research for most efficient, naturalistic and clever Procedural Algorithms group, which are together bundled into fully modular generator of 3D geometrical maps/terrains/landmasses.</p>

<p>Generator result is 3 dimensional, texturised, geometrical mesh, which can be used in video games, maps or in other creative way.</p>

<p>So (if you are into the topic) it's basically No Man's Sky, without a space. But I was first, duh</p>
