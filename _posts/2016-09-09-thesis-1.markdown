<p3>Description:</p3>
<div class="separator"></div>
<p><b>My Engineering (BSc) Thesis (research and dev project).</b></p>

<p>My Engineering Thesis consists of research for most efficient, naturalistic and clever <b>Procedural Algorithms group</b>, which are together bundled into fully <b>modular generator of 3D geometrical</b> maps/terrains/landmasses.</p>



<p>Generator result is 3 dimensional, texturised, geometrical mesh, which can be used in video games, maps or in other creative way.</p>

<p>So (if you are into the topic) it's basically No Man's Sky, without a space. But I was first, duh</p>
