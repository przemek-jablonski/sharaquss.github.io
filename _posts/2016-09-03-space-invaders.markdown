<p> Classic Space Invaders game clone, visually translated to accommodate latter-day and brought to Android. <p>

<p> After learning quite a lot and completing few projects in LibGDX (gamedev/multimedia library) and Android SDK, I was wondering what would happen if I combined those two together.</p>

<p> This is the result. Calibrated for SDKs > 4.1 and screens about 5" size.</p>
