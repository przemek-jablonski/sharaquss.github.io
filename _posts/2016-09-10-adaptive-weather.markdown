<p3>Description:</p3>
<div class="separator"></div>
<p> Little native app which dynamically queries weather API services and alerts user on <b>weather change</b>, periodically or before-event basis.
</p>
<p> It's an answer to all of those huge weather apps on the market (eg. Google Now module or Yahoo! Weather) which offer dynamic <b>push notifications</b> when weather is suddenly (or not) changing.
You know, when you have a budget smartphone, having a heavy ~200mb app is usually out of the question. This is where this project comes in!</p>



<p3>Development:</p3>
<div class="separator"></div>

<p>
    App created with <b>modern Android Development</b> in mind. Picked <b>MVP design pattern</b> for this one, along with most popular open-source libraries that professional Android devs use: <b>Butterknife</b> binder, <b>Dagger</b> dependency injection, <b>Picasso</b>, <b>Realm.io</b> mobile database, GSON etc etc.
    Testing done in <b>JUnit</b> and <b>Mockito</b>.
