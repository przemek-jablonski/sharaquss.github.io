<p> Little native app which dynamically queries weather API services and alerts user on weather change, periodically or before-event basis. <p>

<p> It's an answer to all of those huge weather apps on the market (eg. Google Now module or Yahoo! Weather) which offer dynamic push notifications when weather is suddenly (or not) changing.</p>

<p>You know, when you have a budget smartphone, having a heavy ~200mb app is usually out of the question. This is where this project comes in.</p>
