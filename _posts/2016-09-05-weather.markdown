<p> Lightweight, but robust in backend, weather forecast Android app. <p>

<p> This was my first attempt at learning and completing a project using native Android SDK (with help of a Google Developers page), so it's pretty lame, but I'm not really ashamed of it, because it works and its nice! ;)</p>
