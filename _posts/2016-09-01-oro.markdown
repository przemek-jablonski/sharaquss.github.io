<p> Long-term development project which targets to transform original game idea into somewhat AAA gaming experience. <p>

<p> The idea is to create 3D third-person shooter which redeeming qualities would be Diablo-esque style gameplay, randomly generated user assets (like in Borderlands) and lots of playable content.</p>

<p> This is a project which is created by yours truly in it's entirety, that means gameplay, scripts, design, assets creation, music, sound effects etc etc.</p>


<p> It's also a showcase for the Procedural Landmass Algorithms System that create unique 3D geometrical maps for every single level of the game.</p>
